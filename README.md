# exchanger_symfony
Test Assignment Exchanger

We have created a command for fetching the exchange rates from the https://exchangeratesapi.io/ API.

The Command can be executed as below :

php bin/console app:fetch-exchange-rates

To render all the exchange from the database to the view we have created a table and have listed the same at the /rates route.
